Description: Conventional and regression-based continuous norming methods for psychometric,
    biometric and medical test construction. Percentiles and norm scores are estimated
    via inverse normal transformation and modeled via Taylor polynomials. The
    continuous method reduces the necessary sample size, closes gaps between and
    within the norm groups and decreases error variance in the norm data.
