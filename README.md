# cNORMj - Continuous Norming for Jamovi

## Overview
cNORMj provides conventional and regression-based continuous norming methods for psychometric test development in Jamovi. It is based on the [cNORM package for R](https://cran.r-project.org/package=cNORM) (Lenhard, Lenhard & Gary, 2018).

The continuous norming method produces norm scores by modeling the functional relationship between:
- Raw scores
- Norm scores
- Grouping variables (e.g., age, grade)

This approach:
- Reduces necessary sample size
- Closes gaps between norm groups
- Decreases error variance in norm data
- Smooths sampling errors

## Modules

### Single Group
For norming within a single group (e.g., all participants of the same age/grade).

### Continuous Norming
For creating continuous norms across multiple groups or ages.
