  Conventional and regression-based continuous norming methods for psychometric,
  biometric and medical test construction. Percentiles and norm scores are
  estimated via inverse normal transformation and modeled via Taylor polynomials
  (distribution free) or beta binomial distributions (parametric fitting).  The
  continuous method reduces the necessary sample size, closes gaps between and
  within the norm groups and decreases error variance in the norm data.
